# Dyslexic Fontover
Give a site a "Dyslexic Fontover" with this firefox extension.  Using the [Open Dyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/c), you can change the font on a site to something easier to read with the click of a button.

## How to Use Dyslexic Fontover
When enabled, the "Dyslexic Fontover" extentions will display a "D" in the address bar.  Once clicked, the button will replace the font family on that page with the Open Dyslexic font.
